I was one of 30 engineers to be selected to do a 30 minute talk discussion some technological and architectural wins that I was able to lead at PayPal.

This talk aims to shed light on what has been tried in the past regarding the merchant web experience during my time here at PayPal. The MEP team has firsthand experience designing, architecting, and implementing the approaches that will be covered.

I will also cover my thoughts on micro-front end approaches (both internal and external) and provide my opinions on the direction we should be going in as a merchant experience for our customers and our internal development.
